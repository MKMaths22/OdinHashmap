This project follows the Ruby Hashmap lesson available at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hashmap

The Minitest tests in tests.rb capture the requirements of the lesson.
I adapted my previously written LinkedList class for this project, by commenting out methods the HashMap does not need, checking my HashMap tests all pass.
Also the Node class has been changed so that nodes have both keys and values (previously just values).
